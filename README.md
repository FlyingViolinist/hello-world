Hello Humans in this world (and machines too)

I come in peace and largely in ignorance. I am a musician who has aspirations of learning code because 1 - I need to learn how to think better, 2 - am tired of feeling powerless to the IT people, 3 - Have an idea for a music-practicing app that will make me a small trickle of income that I can add to my other small trickles of income so I can feel justified buying my groceries and 4 - Want to stop being jealous of smart people. I figure if I can write code, I am smart.
